# reject_unauth_pipelining
# Reject the request when the client sends SMTP commands ahead of time where it
# is not allowed, or when the client sends SMTP commands ahead of time without
# knowing that Postfix actually supports ESMTP command pipelining. This stops
# mail from bulk mail software that improperly uses ESMTP command pipelining in
# order to speed up deliveries.

# address, and the MAIL FROM domain has 1) no DNS MX and no DNS A record, or 2)
# a malformed MX record such as a record with a zero-length MX hostname
